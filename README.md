most required libraries including `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
Then download or clone the repository using `git` as follows,

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/surmeierlab/neurphys
```

You can download dependencies which we provide in `requirements.txt`. Use `pip` to install
the rest of dependencies i.e.

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
